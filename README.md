# LIGENT
LIGENT is a platform for langugage-interactive embodied agents.

One day AI will sense the environment as we do, communicate with us through natural language and play with us through embodied actions. LIGENT provides a easy-to-use environment that enables an agent receive texts and first-person-view images as observations and execute actions (including speaking) in a 3d game world, where you can train your AI with reinforcement or supervised learning.
